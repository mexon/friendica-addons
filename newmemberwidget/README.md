New Member Widget
=================

With this addon you can enable a widget for the sidebar of the network tab,
which will be displayed for new members. It contains a linkt to friendicas
introduction pages at /newmember and optionally

 * a link to the global support forum
 * a link to an eventually existing local support forum
 * a welcome message you might want to send to your new members.

There is no extra styling added for this added, so it should work with any
theme you have selected, or your user selects. But it was only tested with
duepuntozero,quattro and clean.

Testing it
----------
You want to test it, but you don't want to create a new account? Take your fav
text editor (yeah emacs will do as well) and edit the newmemberwidget.php file.
In line 21 you will find a if clause, just add a ! infront of the

	x(!_SESSION

that will negate the requirement of being a new member, so don't forget the
remove that ! again after testing ;-)

Translations
------------
If you want to translate this addon, please grab a copy of lang/C/message.po
and copy it to lang/XX/message.po where XX is the language you want to
translate for (i.e. de, fr, nb-no). After you translated the content go to the
root of your friendica directory and run

	php bin/console po2php addon/newmember/lang/XX/message.po

to translate the message.po file into the strings.php file needed by friendica
to catch your translations.

With the translated files, either do a pull request at github, or send me the
two files (message.po and strings.php) you just worked with as attachment to an
email.
